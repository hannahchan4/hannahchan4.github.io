                    <h2>Our History</h2>
                    <p>It all began in 1984 when  Linnaea Phillips created  a gathering place for conversation, music, social events, and, of  course, sharing good food and drink. With the help of many friends, her  vision  of a classic coffee house became a reality. Linnaea's Cafe today is  still a beloved fixture of downtown San Luis Obispo and a popular place  for out-of-towners to visit on their way through.</p>
                    <p>In 2008, Linnaea sold the café to her longtime  manager, Marianne Orme, who's dedicated to keeping  Linnaea’s the eclectic and welcoming center of San Luis Obispo’s coffee house culture. Linnaea’s remains a popular showcase for rising local artists and host to a variety of musical performances, poetry readings,art installations, jazz  jams, and other events.</p>

                    <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
                    <p>Linnaea's has become a much-loved alternative to the corporate work environment. Our relaxed yet lively atmosphere is popular with businesspeople and students alike, providing a refuge and welcome respite from busy city life.</p>
                    <p>We've become a second home to numerous students and  members of the community over the years. We hear it again and again. "Walking into Linnaea’s is like coming home." With such a unique and warm  environment, free Wi-Fi, plenty of good food, good coffee, clean  bathrooms, and free entertainment. Why go anywhere else?</p>
                    <p>There are three distinct environments to hang out in at Linnaea’s. When  you first walk in there is window seating to watch the world go by.  Well, the uniqueness of Garden Street anyway. Then head back to the main  living room filled with tables, art, and a bookcase to peruse.  Continuing further, you enter the garden where you can sit in the sun or  under the flowering arbor for some shade. The table next to the fish  pond is probably the most popular.</p>

                    <h2>Our Town</h2>
                    <p>San Luis Obispo (SLO, SLOtown, or San Luis) is the county seat and home  of California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) with a population  of 45,000, about 1/3 of whom are college students. It is almost exactly  half-way (about a 4 hour drive) between Los Angeles & San Francisco,  and just a few miles from the coast, where Highways 1 and 101 meet.  It is  a quiet and beautiful town, with a very strong sense of community. Town  slows down a bit during the first part of the summer but picks up in  August when Europe takes a vacation. San Luis has a beautiful downtown,  wonderful outdoor concerts during the summer, and great weather year  round. We are blessed to live in such a beautiful place.</p>
